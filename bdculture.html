At the same time, the Hindus observe different festivals (Puja) including Durga Puja, Krishna Janmashtami, Kali Puja, Diwali, Saraswati Puja, and many more pujas.

When the Muslim rulers were in this subcontinent, the literature developed continuously. We see the famous poet  Chandi Das, Alaol, and Daulat Kazi. Then the advent of Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Lalon, Rabindranath Tagore, and Nazrul Islam have made the literature of Bangla more widespread. We can’t deny the contribution of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhaya, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhaya, and Syed Mujtaba Ali.
