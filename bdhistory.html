                    Bangladesh has got independence with the liberation war of 1971 against Pakistan. Then Bangladesh born as a free country. That’s why the historical chapter of Bangladesh is measured from the time of the Liberation War.

In the 18 July 1947, on the Indian Independence Act, it was proposed to form a state with the two Muslim colonial area. Then in the 12 August the area of the country is measured and in the 14 August 1947, Pakistan was established with two provinces called East and West Pakistan. The people of East Pakistan thought it will fulfill the dream and they will get the equal rights and development. After some days, the people of East Pakistan realized, they were wrong. They were not getting the chance to participate in the politics. They were derived from the economic, and business opportunities.

Then the people of East Pakistan realized they need to raise their voice. Similarly, in 1952, the Govt. of West Pakistan declared Urdu as the official language of the two states. But the students of Bangladesh took the position of this statement. In the 21 February 1952, the students started for movement. The armed police of the West Pakistan Govt. fired on the movement and 10 students died on the spot and hundreds of students were injured severely. At last, the people of West Pakistan saved their Mother Tongue. In the 17 November 1999, UNESCO declared the day as the International Mother Language Day. Now it is celebrated as the International Mother Language Day all over the world to give the respect of the Martyrs.

The domination of West Pakistan increased a lot day by day. Then the political party including Awami League started to lead to free-up the country. In the 26 March of 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh as a free nation. The whole nation from all profession joined the movement. They were in the same voice to set free the country. In the meantime, the armed attack following the order of Govt. on the intellectual people of Bangladesh called Operation Searchlight on 25 March was the black day for murdering a lot of unarmed intellectual persons from Bangladesh. Then 26 March was announced to release the country. Now the day is observed as the independence day of Bangladesh. The Awami League leaders formed the exiled Government at Meherpur, Kustia on 17 April 1971. The Mukti Bahini (Freedom Fighter) was established with the participation of the civilian people. The forces were organized into 11 sectors and led by General M. A. G. Osmani. They conducted continuous guerrilla war against the brute of West Pakistan. The sacrifice of life of the countless people forced Pakistan’s military to surrender. At last, after 9 months of battle and the life of 30 lakh people, 16 December 1971 Bangladesh got independence.

The history of Bangladesh bears the courage and the love for their beloved country. The Bengali can achieve anything for the sake of truth and establishing the root. They have proved it in any dangerous situation including the Movement for the mother tongue, the Liberation War of Bangladesh as well as enriching the country after the war.

The culture of Bangladesh is very rich. We have a set of unique and old tradition in our country. The people of Bangladesh are peace lover and they like to meet and collaborate with one another. We have got it from our Ancestor and we are eagerly maintaining the tradition and culture. The people from the world comes here to know the unique history of us. They like the hospitality of the people of Bangladesh. Thus, we are going forward to keep the footprint in every sector of the world.
